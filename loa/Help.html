<h1> Lines of Action </h1>

<p> 
  Lines of Action (LOA) is a board game invented by Claude Soucie.
</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>

<p>Play alternates between Black and White, with Black moving first. Each move consists of moving a piece of your color horizontally, vertically, or diagonally onto an empty square or onto a square occupied by an opposing piece, which is then removed from the board. A piece may jump over friendly pieces (without disturbing them), but may not cross enemy pieces, except one that it captures. A piece must move a number of squares that is exactly equal to the total number of pieces (black and white) on the line along which it chooses to move (the line of action). This line contains both the squares behind and in front of the piece that moves, as well as the square the piece is on. A piece may not move off the board, onto another piece of its color, or over an opposing piece.</p>

<h2>Controlling Play</h2>

<p> Pieces are moved by dragging and dropping if a move is invalid, the piece won't move and you will have to choose another piece</p>

<p> Switch gives you options to choose white/black and switch them from manual and AI back and forth.</p>

<p> Game->Retract undos the most recent moves of you and your opponent.</p>

<p> Help->Manual displays this page. </p>

<p> Game->New resets the board. </p>
<p> Game->Quit exits game. </p>
<h2> Hints </h2>

<p> A good hint is to get your pieces closer to the center. Once you control the center, its easier for you to make winning moves and narder for your opponent. </p>
